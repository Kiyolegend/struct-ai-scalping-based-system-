Strategy 1 — MTF Pullback Precision Scalping
=============================================
Trade in direction of higher timeframe bias (4H + 1H),
wait for pullback on 15M (HL / LH formation),
then use 5M BOS for precise entry with tight stop loss,
and ride the 15M impulse move.

Session 2 fixes applied:
  - 24h age cap on 15M pullback label
  - 1h freshness check on 5M BOS events
  - Tighter distance scoring: 15/10/5 at ≤5/≤10/≤15 pips
  - Counter CHoCH window: 4h look-back with time check

Session 3 refinements applied:
  - Minimum score raised from 80 → 85 (forces stronger confluence)
  - 5M BOS freshness tightened from 2h → 1h (no stale triggers)
  - Distance hard reject tightened from >15p → >10p (no chase entries)
  - Distance scoring: ≤15p tier (5pts) removed — 10p is now the outer limit
  - Counter-BOS filter added: any counter-direction 5M BOS within 30min = skip

Quality upgrades applied (v2):
  - GATE: Post-BOS structure must hold — after the most recent 5M BOS fires,
    subsequent 5M candles must not make a new low (bullish) or new high (bearish)
    beyond the close of the very first post-BOS candle.
    Catches setups where the BOS was valid when it fired but the continuation has
    already failed — prevents entering into a broken 5M structure.

Pullback logic upgrade (v3):
  - CHANGED: 15M bearish bias is now the BEST setup (+30 pts) — it means the
    pullback IS in progress and we are entering before the impulse, not after.
    Previously this was a hard reject, which caused late entries.
  - 15M neutral = good (+20 pts) — pullback may be finishing.
  - 15M bullish = allowed but lower (+15 pts) — continuation, may be extended.
  - BOS freshness tightened 1h → 30 min — a 50-min-old BOS is not the start
    of the impulse. 30 min keeps entry at the very beginning of the move.
  - Entry distance tightened 13p → 10p outer limit; tiers 3/7/10p.
  - CHoCH soft filter: 1 counter CHoCH = allowed (that IS the pullback starting).
    Reject only when 2+ counter CHoCHs exist with no bullish/bearish structural
    recovery in between — that indicates a genuine reversal, not a pullback.

Institutional confluence upgrade (v4):
  - Zone scoring upgraded 5pts → 10pts max, now checks WHERE THE 15M HL FORMED
    not just where price currently sits.
    * 10pts: 15M HL formed at a demand zone or S/R level AND current price is
      still within that zone — the pullback found institutional support and we
      are entering exactly at the zone.
    * 5pts: 15M HL at zone/S&R only (price moved slightly past it — level was
      respected but entry is a pip or two above the zone).
    * 5pts: current price in zone only (zone present, but HL didn't form there).
    * 0pts: no zone confluence at all.
  - To keep max score = 100, session bonus reduced 10pts → 5pts.
    Rationale: session timing is a circumstantial filter (you can't force a setup
    during London); zone confluence is a structural quality signal about the
    specific setup itself and deserves higher weight.
    - New score breakdown: bias(30) + pullback(20) + bos(20) + loc(15) + sess(5)
    + zone(10) = 100 max.

1H structure alignment bonus (v5):
  - Optional bonus: +5pts when the 15M pullback HL aligns with a confirmed 1H HL.
  - NOT a gate — good setups without 1H alignment still fire.
  - When combined with zone confluence (HL+price@zone = 10pts) this can push
    score to 105 in the best cases. Threshold stays at 85.
  - Data is already in state["1h"]["structure"] — no new endpoints needed.

Asia range alignment bonus (v6):
  - Optional bonus: +5pts when the 15M pullback HL formed at the Asia session
    high (bullish) or Asia session low (bearish).
  - Only relevant during London open — Asia range becomes key S/R after break.
  - Data already in state["asia_range"] — no new endpoints needed.
  - Theoretical max with all bonuses: 110 pts. Threshold stays at 85.

15M HL recency bonus (v7):
  - Optional bonus: +5pts if pullback HL formed < 4h ago, +3pts if < 12h ago.
  - Within the 24h cap, a fresh HL means the pullback just completed — the
    institutional absorption is recent and the impulse is imminent.
  - Uses pb_time already computed in Step 3 — zero extra data needed.
  - Theoretical max with all bonuses: 115 pts. Threshold stays at 85.

Strategy 2 — Liquidity Sweep Reversal Scalping
===============================================
Exploit liquidity grabs (fake breakouts) where price sweeps previous
highs/lows, traps traders, then reverses.

Quality upgrades applied (v2):
  - GATE: Sweep wick must reach ≥3 pips beyond sweep level (real grab, not a touch).
  - GATE: Post-reversal structure must hold — candles after CHoCH cannot make a new
    low (bullish) or new high (bearish) below/above the first post-CHoCH close.
  - GATE: BOS sweep entry tightened from 25p → 20p (CHoCH sweeps keep 25p).
  - BONUS: FVG at sweep level +10 pts (institutional order imbalance at exact level).
  - BONUS: 4H Order Block at sweep level +10 pts (macro institutional intent).

Tightening applied (post live trading review):
  - BOS + BOS combo rejected — at least one CHoCH required.
  - CHoCH sweeps: max age 6h. BOS sweeps: max age 2h.
    (Was 24h — root cause of most stale-sweep losses.)
  - 5M confirmation window tightened from 2h → 1h.
  - Hard reject: sweep older than 4h AND entry >15p from sweep level.
    (Stale + far = double-weak, always reject.)
  - Freshness bonus tiered: <2h = +10pts, 2-4h = +5pts, >4h = 0.
  - Net RR now uses total cost (spread + Nexus commission pip gap).
  - BOS sweeps require London/NY session.
  - BOS sweeps require 7-pip minimum recovery (CHoCH = 5 pip).

Confirmation freshness upgrade (v3):
  - 5M reversal confirmation window tightened 1h → 30 min.
    A 55-minute-old CHoCH means you are entering near the end of the reversal
    move, not the start. 30 min keeps entry at the very beginning of the
    reversal leg — when maximum reward distance is still ahead.
    Same fix as Scalp1 v3b which was the single biggest improvement to S1.

Zone quality gradient upgrade (v4):
  - Zone scoring upgraded from binary 0/10 to 3-tier 0/5/10/15:
    * 15pts: sweep level within 5 pips of zone center — deepest institutional core
             (the liquidity grab hit exactly where institutional orders sat)
    * 10pts: sweep level within zone bounds, correct zone half — zone respected
    *  5pts: current price in zone only — partial context, sweep not at zone
    *  0pts: no zone confluence at all
  - Session score reduced 10pts → 5pts to correct the documented max score.
    Reason: strongly_trending markets are hard-rejected at Step 1, so both 4H
    and 1H can never be aligned at the same time as a valid S2 setup — the real
    HTF max was always 5pts, making the true achievable max 140 not 145. Zone
    upgrade (+5) + session reduction (-5) keeps the normal max at 140.

1H structure alignment bonus (v5):
  - Optional bonus: +5pts when the sweep level coincides (within 10 pips) with a
    confirmed 1H structural point (1H HL for bullish sweeps, 1H LH for bearish).
  - When the liquidity grab happens AT a 1H structural level, the reversal has
    institutional backing at two timeframes — one of the strongest S2 confluence
    signals possible (sweep engineered at a known institutional level).
  - NOT a gate — setups without 1H alignment still fire. Bonus only stacks.
  - Data already in state["1h"]["structure"] — no new API calls needed.
  - New theoretical max: 140 + 5 = 145 pts.

Confirmation recency bonus (v6):
  - Optional bonus: up to +5pts based on how fresh the 5M CHoCH/BOS confirmation is.
    A 5-minute-old CHoCH means you are entering at the very start of the reversal
    leg — full reward distance ahead. A 28-minute-old CHoCH means 5+ candles of
    the reversal have already printed and you are entering the middle of the move.
  - < 10 min old = +5pts  (first 2 candles of the reversal — ideal entry)
  - < 30 min old = +3pts  (still early in the reversal)
  - ≥ 30 min old =  0pts  (at the limit — reversal may be mostly complete)
  - Uses confirm_event.get("time") already computed in Step 4 — zero extra data.
  - New theoretical max: 145 + 5 = 150 pts.

Reversal candle fix (v7):
  - BUGFIX: Reversal candle quality check (post-filter) now only scans candles
    AT OR AFTER the confirmation event timestamp. Previously scanned all last 12
    candles (60 min) with no time filter — could match the large sweep candle
    itself or strong pre-CHoCH candles, crediting prior movement as "reversal
    strength." Fix uses conf_ts (already computed in v6 step) to filter the loop.

Scoring (max 150):
  Sweep quality    — 25 (CHoCH) or 10 (BOS)
  Reversal confirm — 25 (5M CHoCH) or 10 (5M BOS)
  Market condition — 15 (ranging) or 5 (slight trend)
  Entry precision  — 15 (≤5p) / 10 (≤15p) / 5 (>15p from sweep)
  Zone confluence  — 15 (sweep@core) / 10 (sweep@zone) / 5 (price@zone) / 0  ← v4
  Session timing   — 5  ← v4 reduced from 10 to correct max
  Freshness bonus  — 10 (<2h) / 5 (2–4h) / 0 (>4h)
  HTF alignment    — up to 5 (strongly-trending = rejected, so only 1 TF can align)
  SR level bonus   — 5
  FVG at level     — 10
  4H OB at level   — 10
  1H struct bonus  — 5   ← v5 new
  Conf recency     — 5   ← v6 new

  Minimum to fire  : 88 (S2 local min — see note at score check)
